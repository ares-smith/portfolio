        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a test for my DIGIT100 class. This is an example of a <a href="about.html">relative link</a> to a page inside the same folder.</p>
        <p>In this, I will be practicing some <u>different HTML things</u> to try and learn how to use it properly like <i>italics</i> and <b>bolding</b> as well as including <a
                href="https://youtu.be/QDia3e12czc">a link to an external
            website</a> inside text.</p>
        <h6>I'm also an artist, so here's one of my works. </h6>
        <figure><img src="images/galadrawing.jpg"/><figcaption>A painting made of my original character based off of the painting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fallen_Angel_%28painting%29"><i>The Fallen Angel</i></a> by Alexandre Cabanel in 1847.</figcaption></figure>
       
        <h2>What did I use to make this painting?</h2>
        <p>Using a function called an unordered list, I shall tell you!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Canvas board (12x18in I believe)</li>
            <li>Acrylic paint</li>
            <li>Synthetic fiber paintbrushes</li>
            <li>Several hours of work...</li>
            <li>Water in a red solo cup</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Some other things I painted for class.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Characters (usually my own)</li>
            <li>Landscapes (though I'm not a big fan...)</li>
            <li>Abstract piece</li>
            <li>Still life pieces</li>
        </ol>
