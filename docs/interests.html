        <p><i>Pokemon - I've been a fan of Pokemon since I was 3 years old. It's safe to say it'll be a lifelong interest of mine, seeing as I've ben going strong for nearly 20 years!</i></p>

            <p><i>Houseki no Kuni - I found it around 2019 - 2020 when my highschool went on lockdown, and I've been a fan ever since. One of my favourite medias to this day, I own most of the merchandise that has been released, including every volume in it's original language and every art book.</i></p>

            <p><i>I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream - another one of my favourite works, despite the fact that it's so short compared to the other two. I sat and watched several analyses on it after initially reading the short story. I even bought the old point-and-click adventure game!</i></p>
